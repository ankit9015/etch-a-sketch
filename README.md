# etch-a-sketch

This is a sketch app, where you can sketch over a board.

The board is made as a representation of pixels in screen that changes color when hovered over.

Here, I have used DOM manipulation intensively for the board. The board cell changes its color because of a new class appending in it.

The project is created using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JS.
